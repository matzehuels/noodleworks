    "# Solving a Multi-Constraint Knapsack Problem with Boundhound\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll solve a complex knapsack problem using the boundhound library. This problem demonstrates the power of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for solving real-world optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 6 items, each with different characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item | Value | Weight | Volume | Cost | Description |\n",
    "|------|--------|---------|---------|-------|-------------|\n",
    "| 1    | 30     | 8       | 3       | 7     | High value, high weight, low volume |\n",
    "| 2    | 28     | 7       | 4       | 6     | Similar to item 1 |\n",
    "| 3    | 20     | 4       | 7       | 3     | Medium value, low weight, high volume |\n",
    "| 4    | 18     | 3       | 8       | 2     | Similar to item 3 |\n",
    "| 5    | 15     | 5       | 5       | 4     | Balanced item |\n",
    "| 6    | 14     | 6       | 4       | 5     | Balanced item |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "1. Total weight must be ≤ 15 (tight - can only take 2-3 items)\n",
    "2. Total volume must be ≤ 16 (tight - can only take 2-3 items)\n",
    "3. Total cost must be ≤ 12 (very tight - can only take 2 expensive or 3-4 cheap items)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Maximize the total value of selected items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes This Problem Interesting?\n",
    "1. Items come in complementary pairs with different trade-offs:\n",
    "   - Items 1&2: High value but expensive and heavy\n",
    "   - Items 3&4: Medium value, light but high volume\n",
    "   - Items 5&6: Balanced but not optimal for any single metric\n",
    "2. The LP relaxation will be fractional because:\n",
    "   - No single item dominates on all metrics\n",
    "   - Tight constraints force fractional combinations\n",
    "3. Multiple feasible integer solutions exist with similar values\n",
    "4. Branch and bound will need to prune branches due to:\n",
    "   - Weight/volume constraints eliminating heavy/bulky combinations\n",
    "   - Cost constraint preventing selection of too many expensive items"

    "\n",
    "2. **Constraint Usage**: Notice how:\n",
    "   - At least one constraint is nearly at capacity (binding constraint)\n",
    "   - Other constraints have some slack\n",
    "   - This confirms we've found a corner point of the feasible region\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Branch and Bound Performance**:\n",
    "   - The number of nodes processed shows how efficiently the solver found the solution\n",
    "   - The MIP gap confirms we've found the global optimum\n",
    "   - The visualization shows the branching decisions that led to this solution\n",
