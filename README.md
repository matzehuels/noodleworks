# 🍜 Noodleworks
For noodling on ideas and foundational experimentation. A playful collection of small projects to rediscover and master the basics.

## Projects

1. 👶🏻 🔥 **[TinyTorch](./tinytorch)**: A minimal automatic differentiation library inspired by PyTorch. Implements reverse-mode autodiff with tensor operations, neural network activations, and computational graph visualization. Perfect for understanding how modern deep learning frameworks work under the hood.

2. 🐶 📈 **[BoundHound](./boundhound)**: A minimal branch-and-bound optimization solver. Demonstrates solving mixed-integer programming problems using the revised simplex method. Best for exploring the foundations of modern optimization solvers like Gurobi.
